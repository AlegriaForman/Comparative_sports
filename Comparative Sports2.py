# # Hypothesis Testing
#
# You are a data analyst for a basketball team and have access to a large set of historical data that you can use to
# analyze performance patterns. The coach of the team and your management have requested that you perform
# several hypothesis tests to statistically validate claims about your team's performance. This analysis will provide
# evidence for these claims and help make key decisions to improve the performance of the team. You will use the
# Python programming language to perform the statistical analyses and then prepare a report of your findings for the
# teamâ€™s management. Since the managers are not data analysts, you will need to interpret your findings and
# describe their practical implications.
#
# The ELO rating, represented by the variable **elo_n**, is used as a measure of the relative skill of a team. This
# measure is inferred based on the final score of a game, the game location, and the outcome of the game relative to
# the probability of that outcome. The higher the number, the higher the relative skill of a team.
#
#
# In addition to studying data on your own team, your management has also assigned you a second team so that
# you can compare its performance with your own team's.
#
# ## Step 1: Data Preparation & the Assigned Team
# This step uploads the data set from a CSV file. It also selects the Assigned Team for this analysis.
#
# 1. The **Assigned Team** is <font color='blue'><strong>Chicago Bulls</strong></font> from the years <font
# color='blue'><strong>1996 - 1998</strong></font>

# ## Step 6: Hypothesis Test for the Difference Between Two Population Means
# The management of your team wants to compare the team with the assigned team (the Bulls in 1996-1998). They
claim that the skill level of your team in 2013-2015 is the same as the skill level of the Bulls in 1996 to 1998. In
other words, the mean relative skill level of your team in 2013 to 2015 is the same as the mean relative skill level of
the Bulls in 1996-1998. Test this claim using a 1% level of significance. Assume that the population standard
deviation is unknown.
